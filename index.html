        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi my name is Victor. I am a Third Year Computer Science student at Cal Poly Pomona. I have been programming for over a year now. During my time at Cal Poly I've been introduced and have taking courses in Java, C&#43;&#43;, and MIPS Assembly. So far my core courses have given me an introductory look at data structures and creating efficent algorithms. Now that I have completed most of my fundamental courses I will begin taking more exploratory upper division courses during the 2016 - 2017 academic year. I have ver much enjoyed my time at Cal Poly and like to be involved on campus. I am currently the Public Representative of the <b>Computer Science Society</b>, the local ACM chapter at Cal Poly. Personally I have found an interest in web development and have taken up HTML and plan to learn CSS and JavaScript outside of the classroom.</p>

        <p>While attending Cal Poly I have made Pomona my home. I have lived within a few miles of campus during my time there. Other than programming my passions include music production, automotives and video games. I produce electronic music. Artists that I admire and look to inspiration include Hex Cougar, Graves, and Circa Survive. In highschool I took multiple automotive courses and enjoy performing routine maintenance for my family on their cars. I don't play video games very much any more but as a kid I was a big fan of all things Nintendo. Some of my favorite intellectual properties are Paper Mario, Pokemon, and Super Smash Bros.</p>
